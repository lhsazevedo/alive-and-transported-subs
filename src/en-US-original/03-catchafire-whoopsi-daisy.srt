1
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:37,992
Just lean with us

2
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,334
Slackin' off like a bum,
I'm feelin' ho hum

3
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:48,707
I'm feelin' luke warm
like the water in my tub

4
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:51,836
Started out and we was hot,
looked up and now we're not

5
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:55,033
We had that fire like we was boilin' in an pot

6
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,925
Whoopsi-daisy (3x)
Come, we gonna catch that

7
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:04,065
Fire, I'm feenin' for a flicker
Then we'll fan the flame up into something bigger

8
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:07,137
Started out and we was hot
looked up and now we're not

9
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:10,376
We gonna catch a fire, catch a fire for God
Come now!

10
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:15,339
Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

12
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:25,737
Fire, takin' it from warm to hot (we go)
Fire, gotta give it all we got (we go)

13
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:30,660
Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

14
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,218
Nirva D., what you got for me?

15
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:34,924
What you got for Houston, Texas?

16
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,560
Spark to a flame
I'm flippin' up my game

17
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:40,049
I caught the fire
and I'll never be the same

18
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:42,998
So unexplainable
I can't contain it, son

19
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:46,177
And my retaining it would only be a shame
So let me hear you say

20
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,415
Whoopsi-daisy
(Whoopsi-daisy)

21
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:48,719
Whoopsi-daisy
(Whoopsi-daisy)

22
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:50,807
Whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

23
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,515
Heat,
Like the Kingston concrete

24
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:55,190
There ain't no stoppin' the fire
(Shonlock)

25
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,988
We're straight breakin' ground
There ain't no cooling this thing down

26
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,361
I'll put it up and keep'n
it krunk as we know how

27
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,470
Hear me now people

28
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:06,150
Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

29
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:11,526
Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

30
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:16,776
Fire, takin' it from warm to hot (we go)
Fire, gotta give it all we got (we go)

31
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:21,726
Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

32
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:22,806

Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

35
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,897
What's goin' on Texas?

36
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,543
Are you ready to
catch a fire tonight?

37
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:47,207
Hoo-a-hoo, down down down
Here come the boy from Tennessee town

38
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:52,341
Hoo-a-oo, --?--

39
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:56,972

I confess it with my mouth just to make it flow

00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:05,317
Catch a fire

Call me crazy

44
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:16,440
Whoopsi-daisy
