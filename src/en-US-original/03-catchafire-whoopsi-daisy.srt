Spark to a flame
I'm flippin' up my game

22
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:40,049
I caught the fire

23
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:42,998
So unexplainable
I can't contain it, son

24
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:46,177
And my retaining it would only be a shame
So let me hear you say

There ain't no stoppin' the fire

30
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:57,988
We're straight breakin' ground
There ain't no cooling this thing down

Here come that boy boy boy...

51
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:54,209
Even if I'm christian as a way to go

52
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:57,005
I'm confessin' it with my mouth
just to make it flow

53
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:59,683
Then I'm feeling the Holy Spirit
From <i>mi</i> head to <i>mi</i> toe

Then he fillin' up <i>mi</i> cup
