1
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,370
Start it up,
turn it on

2
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:07,289
Start it up,
turn it on

3
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:10,841
Start it up, turn it on
We can ride this storm

4
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:13,825
A grip of hope in our hands
For the coming dawn

5
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:17,896
Up to our necks in complexities
Causing us to pause

6
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:19,346
As we collect our thoughts

7
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:22,692
So don't blink if you wanna
come cross the border

8
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,508
Take a look around
or come test the water

9
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,330
We won't stop
'till we see the morning

10
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:30,782
So welcome to the quiet
before the storm hits

11
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:34,840
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody

12
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:37,762
Come on, come on
and turn on the ignition

13
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,602
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody

14
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:44,197
Come on, come on
and turn on the ignition

15
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:46,693
Take it up a notch

16
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:49,034
Take it up a notch

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,642
Comatose, Half-hearted
Room temperature's fine

18
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,426
Sleep walking, no dream
is even filling our minds

19
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:57,295
Earth quaking,
We be shaking like a wake up bomb

20
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:00,067
This ain't no trouble overseas
No Vietnam

21
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:03,392
So don't blink if you wanna
come cross the border

22
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:06,108
Take a look around
or come test the water

23
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:08,930
We won't stop
'till we see the morning

24
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,960
So welcome to the quiet
before the storm hits

25
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,293
Take it up a notch

26
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:17,634
Houston!
Take it up a notch

27
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:20,740
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody

28
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:23,592
Come on, come on
and turn on the ignition

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,302

Come on, come on
and turn on the ignition

35
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,379
Sleep walking
I'm sleep walking

36
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,919
Sleep walking
I'm still talking

37
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:54,600
Come spark the parts in me that all but died

38
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,481
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside

39
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:00,296
Hold up the flag 'cause it's ride or die

40
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:05,444
Hold up the flag 'cause it's ride or die

41
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:31,720
Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody

42

00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,442
Turn on the ignition,
Turn on

50
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:57,334
