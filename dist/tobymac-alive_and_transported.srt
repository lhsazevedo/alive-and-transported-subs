A grip of hope in our hands
For the coming dawn

9
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:17,896
Up to our necks in complexities
Causing us to pause

10
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:19,346
As we collect our thoughts

11
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:22,695
So don't blink if you wanna
come cross the border

12
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:25,508
