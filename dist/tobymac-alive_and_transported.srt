8
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:13,738
A grip of hope in our hands
For the coming dawn

9
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:17,959
Up to our necks in complexities
Causing us to pause

10
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:19,307
As we collect our thoughts

11
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:22,770
So don't blink if you wanna
come cross the border

12
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:25,610
Take a look around
or come test the water

13

We won't stop
'till we see the morning

14

Comatose, Half-hearted
Room temperature's fine

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,471
Sleep walking, no dream
